# vindinium-go
A Vindinium bot using GoLang.

It takes two possible command line arguments - 

| Mode        | BotName           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Training     | randomBot |
| Arena      | samuraiBot      |

```
./vindinium-go training randomBot
./vindinium-go arena samuraiBot
```
If all is working well you should see output that looks like the following:

```
